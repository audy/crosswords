Attempting to make a crossword puzzle generator

Output looks something like this:

```
                           p
                           h
                           i
             p hackleback  l
             e        d    o
             r        o    g
             c        p    y
             u        t    n
             t  haberdashery
             a     r  butyrous
             n     y  i
            revelant  l
             o     h  i
             u     r  t
             s     o  y
             l     l
             y     y
                   s
                   i
                   n
```

The output isn't perfect as the algorithm will place words next to each other
without making sure that new words aren't invented. And I still have no idea
how to generate the clues.
